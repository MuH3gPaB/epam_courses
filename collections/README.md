COLLECTIONS IMPLEMENTATION HOME WORK
==================================

Welcome to collections implementations home work page!

HashMap [(source)](https://github.com/MuH3gPaB/epam_courses/blob/master/collections/src/main/java/my/epam/collections/CustomHashMap.java) [(test)](https://github.com/MuH3gPaB/epam_courses/blob/master/collections/src/test/java/my/epam/collections/CustomHashMapTest.java)
----------
Custom implementation of java.util.Map<K, V> interface.

Hash table logic inside.

Complete functionality of Map contract is implemented, include backed 
entrySet, keySet and values.

Null keys not allowed.

Null values supported.

TreeMap [(source)](https://github.com/MuH3gPaB/epam_courses/blob/master/collections/src/main/java/my/epam/collections/CustomTreeMap.java) [(test)](https://github.com/MuH3gPaB/epam_courses/blob/master/collections/src/test/java/my/epam/collections/CustomTreeMapTest.java)
----------
Custom implementation of java.util.SortedMap<K, V> interface.

Balanced black/red tree inside.

All methods of SortedMap implemented and tested.

_Note: SubMap is backed, but submap's entrySet, keySet, values are not backed 
and unmodifiable._

ArrayList [(source)](https://github.com/MuH3gPaB/epam_courses/blob/master/collections/src/main/java/my/epam/collections/CustomArrayList.java) [(test)](https://github.com/MuH3gPaB/epam_courses/blob/master/collections/src/test/java/my/epam/collections/CustomListTest.java)
----------
Very simple variation of ArrayList.

[CustomArrayList](https://github.com/MuH3gPaB/epam_courses/blob/master/collections/src/main/java/my/epam/collections/CustomArrayList.java) class implements [CustomList](https://github.com/MuH3gPaB/epam_courses/blob/master/collections/src/main/java/my/epam/collections/CustomList.java) interface, 
that contains 12 most popular methods of java.util.List interface.

Here we have: add, get, set, remove, contains, clear, isEmpty, size, 
iterator (with removing), indexOf, add (by index), remove (by index) methods.

Initial capacity is 10 and could not be changed on creating instance.

LinkedList [(source)](https://github.com/MuH3gPaB/epam_courses/blob/master/collections/src/main/java/my/epam/collections/CustomLinkedList.java) [(test)](https://github.com/MuH3gPaB/epam_courses/blob/master/collections/src/test/java/my/epam/collections/CustomListTest.java)
----------
Very simple, like previous task, class - variation of LinkedList.
 
Implements [CustomList](https://github.com/MuH3gPaB/epam_courses/blob/master/collections/src/main/java/my/epam/collections/CustomList.java), so have 12 methods, listed before.

Based on one-sided list.
