question1=How Java enabled High Performance?
question2=What do you mean by Object?
question3=What is a Local Variable?
question4=What is Singleton class?
question5=What is a static variable?
question6=When parseInt() method can be used?
question7=Why is StringBuffer called mutable?
answer1=Java uses Just-In-Time compiler to enable high performance. Just-In-Time compiler is a program that turns Java bytecode, which is a program that contains instructions that must be interpreted into instructions that can be sent directly to the processor.
answer2=Object is a runtime entity and its state is stored in fields and behavior is shown via methods. Methods operate on an object's internal state and serve as the primary mechanism for object-to-object communication.
answer3=Variables defined inside methods, constructors or blocks are called local variables. The variable will be declared and initialized within the method and it will be destroyed when the method has completed.
answer4=Singleton class control object creation, limiting the number to one but allowing the flexibility to create more objects if the situation changes.
answer5=Class variables also known as static variables are declared with the static keyword in a class, but outside a method, constructor or a block.
answer6=This method is used to get the primitive data type of a certain String.
answer7=The String class is considered as immutable, so that once it is created a String object cannot be changed. If there is a necessity to make alot of modifications to Strings of characters then StringBuffer should be used.
